<p>The Boston Industrial Workers of the World want to help you improve the conditions of your workplace. If you have questions, or would like to begin organizing your workplace, please enter your name below along with your phone number, email, and/or social media link, whichever is the best way to contact you. We will have one of our organizers contact you as soon as possible.</p>
<p>You do <em>not</em> need to include the name of the business you work for, the address, or any other identifying information. Provide as much basic info as you can, though, like size of workplace, or the nature of the industry. And, of course, anything that you want to share about your personal experience on the job.</p>
<p>We also take the confidential nature of any information shared seriously.</p>
<p>Solidarity.</p>
