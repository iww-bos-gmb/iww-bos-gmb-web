# Join the IWW

The IWW is a union for all workers — One Big Union! Join the Boston General Membership Branch today!

[Join on IWW "Red Card"](https://iww.org/join)

[Why join the IWW?](why-join)


## Who can join the IWW?
As long as you are a worker — not an employer — you can join the IWW. Members of other unions (except officers), students, retirees, the unemployed, the self-employed, those in informal professions, and those unable to work may also join. Learn why you should join the IWW.


## Dues
You select your dues level based on your self-reported current monthly income. Your first month as a member will include an initiation fee that is the equivalent of your dues rate. A breakdown of our current dues rate can be found below, as well as on page twenty-six of the IWW's constitution.

* $6 — if you are financially burdened by unemployment, underemployment, being a student, or other circumstances
* $11 — if you make less than $2,000 per month
* $22 — if you make between $2,000 and $3,500 per month
* $33 — if you make more than $3,500 per month


Getting online with us & coming to meetings
After becoming a member, we encourage you to come to a Boston new member orientation (online) or meet with a branch delegate.
