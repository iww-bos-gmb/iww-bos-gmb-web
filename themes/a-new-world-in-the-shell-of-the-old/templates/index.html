          The I.W.W. (Industrial Workers of the World) is a member-run union for
          all workers, a union dedicated to organizing on the job, in our
          industries and in our communities. Here are some I.W.W. Fun Facts:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Founded in Chicago in 1905</li>
          <li>I.W.W. members are referred to as wobblies</li>
          <li>
            There are general membership branches all around the
            world—Australia, Germany & Austria, The United Kingdom, & China, just
            to name a few!
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We are the Industrial Workers of the World because we organize
          industrially. This means we organize all workers producing the same
          goods or providing the same services into one big union, rather than
          dividing workers by skill or trade, so we can pool our strength to win
          our demands together.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the I.W.W. was founded in 1905, we have made significant
          contributions to the labor struggles around the world and have a proud
          tradition of organizing across gender, ethnic, and racial lines long
          before such organizing was popular.
        </p>

        <p>
          We invite you to become a member whether or not the I.W.W. happens to
          have representation rights in your workplace. We organize the worker,
          not the job, and recognize that unions are not about government
          certification or employer recognition but about workers coming
          together to address common concerns. Sometimes this means refusing to
          work with dangerous equipment and chemicals. Other times it means
          agitating around particular issues or grievances in a workplace or
          industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          The IWW in Boston, MA strives to build local and regional working
          class solidarity as a General Membership Branch of the IWW through
          organizing, advocacy, and promotion of worker’s rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Membership in the branch is by voluntary association of members in
          good standing of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) who reside
          or work in the Greater Boston Area and much of the Eastern half of
          Massachusetts.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            If you are a worker—not an employer or member of law enforcement—you
            can join the IWW. If you are unemployed you can join the IWW!
          </strong>
